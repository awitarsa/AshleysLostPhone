    "As we are nearing graduation as upperclassmen in college, we are now more than ever concerned about the return on academic investment given the current economic climate. We wonder exactly what, and if there are any, characteristics of colleges that lead to higher monetary returns after four-years of university. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our problem is a regression problem because our response variable (Y) is the mid-career salary of graduated undergraduate students, which is a continuous variable. We are interested in using inference because we are identifying the relationship between multiple university predictors –  Baron’s selectivity scale, student/faculty ratio, student population, and average tuition costs – and the resulting return on education (measured here by mid-career salary). For instance, we are going to try to identify if a university’s average tuition costs impact the students’ mid-career salary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because our proposal is a regression problem, we will be assessing model accuracy with the root mean squared error (RMSE). We will optimize RMSE because we want to penalize larger outliers more. For example, certain schools that are not as selective may have an exceptionally high mid-year salary in the dataset because of certain outlier high-performing individuals that skew the average – we want our model to be more sensitive to these outliers. \n",
    "\n",
    "We may need to do variable selection to improve our model. From the initial outlook, the variables have a linear relationship with the response variable, so variable transformation will not seem to be needed; however, our variables may be correlated or collinear with each other. For instance, we predict tuition costs to be correlated with student/faculty ratio, student population, and selectivity. If we do variable selection, we should be able to improve our model and obtain a better fit. \n"
